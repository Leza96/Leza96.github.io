            <p id="project-p">Liger Leadership Academy is committed to nurturing highly-skilled entrepreneurial thinkers who are globally-minded, determined, ethical, passionate, and effective. We aren’t waiting for tomorrow; we are changing our own country now. Liger has provided students many opportunities to experience and explore new things and their passion throughout the project which we call exploration. Exploration is a project-based learning experience focused on finding solution to real-world problems where students work together in groups to explore relevant, often complex questions problem or challenge. By engaging real issues in the outside world, students focus on big picture systems thinking and create a final product or action that causes change or serves a meaningful purpose. It also to ensure that students are engaging in critical thinking, problem-solving and decision making in contexts that are relevant to them. During an exploration, a facilitator will give each individual group of students the general direction of the exploration to achieve a set of a goal without emerging in. This allow the students to take advantage of meaningful opportunities that arise during the exploration and focus on higher levels of understanding and the big picture of the problems as much as possible. This project-based learning experience aims to see the big impact of the students toward their own countries. Throughout these past few years, I’ve done many exploration and I did impact a lot to the countries. Some of my <b>favorite explorations</b> are Traditional Food in Cambodia, Outdoor Leadership and Indigenous Community.

            <b>Khmer Traditional Food exploration</b> is a seven weeks project which basically focuses on Khmer food and helps to promoted Khmer food back. In this exploration, I’ve learned a lot such as skills, to know my goals clearer, interview skills, etc… Overall, I feel that I have learned a lot from this exploration and it teach me to feel in love with my country more and more. Especially, I have changed my mindset that being chef is easy. A chef is really important to the country and if we don’t give value to the chef the country won’t be developed because when the visitor comes to the country the first thing they look for is food. So, if the food is unclean the visitor wouldn’t want to come to visit and that makes the country has low tourist site. I encourage everyone to stop looking down the chef. We also create a website that has all of our work which of my and my team. Here is the <a href="http://khmercuisine.ligeracademyblog.org/">link</a>

            <b></b> Observing nature is always one of the pleasurable things I ever had. Seeing blue birds that I never expect that they exist in Cambodia. I really like all the detail colors that one their feathers. It’s looks very colorful. When I observe nature I start to feel relax, joyul, excited. Throughout this trip, I feel that I learn a lot about nature. One of the most interest me is I got to learn about life in the forest. I’m really grateful to learn about people’s lives in the forest, the way they cook food, the different kind of food that they eat. I got to eat Prong food which one of indigenous food. I saw that all the vegetables came from the tree in the forest. I also learn how to put meat in the bamboo to roast. I hope to experience more. The most challenging things to me is hiking. I feel very exhausted and tired but because of the happiness we built together like joking, singing around, it help me to reduce the tiredness a lot. Also I drank a lot of water throughout the hike and it helped to release my tiredness. Moreover, even we was very tired but we never give on our hike and I think I’ve learn a lot from this trip and it’s one of the unforgettable memory to me. <b>Outdoor Leadership exploration</b> is one of a great opportunity for me to take.

                <b>Indigenous Community Exploration</b> Indigenous Community exploration is a seven weeks project to research and learn about some indigenous groups in Cambodia. We only focus on two indigenous group which are Kui ( Preah Vihear) and Steing ( Kratie). There are 9 theme to focus on and learn about. They are ceremony, food, geography, norm/belief, education/ healthcare, economy/daily life, language, music/art and people/ environment. The goals of this exploration help to promote and preserve indigenous groups. Throughout this exploration we also want to improve our interview skills, writing skills, photography skills, designing skill and video skills. At the end of this exploration we publish a book of Kui community and video of Steing community. Overall, I have learned a lot from this exploration, not just skills but also how we can work as team, problem solver and how to adapt to situation which sometime we don’t have bathroom to take shower and we have only well so we have to adapt to that kind of situation. That’s just one situation that we facing but there are more problem that need to solve. Also, I have impacted a lot to this country by help to promote indigenous group. I hope to help the country more. Here is the link of our blog. <a href="http://khmercuisine.ligeracademyblog.org/">blog.</a>
